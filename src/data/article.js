        paragraph1: "“This will enable local government units (LGUs) that have been performing well to enjoy their efforts under a lower alert level while keeping those with poor vaccination performances at higher alert levels,” he said. “This will serve as a reminder to LGUs who continue to have low vaccination numbers to ramp up their efforts,” Diaz added.",

        paragraph1: "The region is reporting over 1 million new COVID-19 cases about every two days, according to a Reuters analysis. With more than half of the world’s population, Asia contributes 21% of all reported COVID-19 cases. The highly contagious but less deadly BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron has pushed the figures to greater highs in recent weeks in countries such as South Korea, China and Vietnam. BA.2 now represents nearly 86% of all sequenced cases, according to the World Health Organization. South Korea leads the world in the daily average number of new cases reported, accounting for one in every four infections reported globally each day, as per Reuters analysis.",
        paragraph2: "While the number of cases has levelled off since earlier in March, the country is still reporting over 300 deaths on average each day, with authorities ordering crematoriums nationwide to operate longer. China is trying to tame its worst outbreak since the pandemic began. The rise in COVID cases in Shanghai, fuelled by the BA.2 substrain, has prompted the financial hub to go into lockdown. The city moved into a two-staged lockdown of its 26 million residents on Monday, restricting movement through bridges and highways to contain the spread. China has reported over 45,000 new cases since the start of this year, a figure higher than it reported in all of 2021. Even though China has inoculated 90% of its population, not enough elderly people have received booster doses, making them susceptible to reinfections."

        paragraph1: "The two candidates asserted that it is their mandate to participate in and pursue such a probe initiated by the upper chamber. They opposed the idea that there would be a conflict of interest on their part if they would not exclude themselves from investigating since they are running in the upcoming elections. Lacson and Sotto said that being candidates, they should also be concerned and involved when there is talk of cheating. “Ibig sabihin nila, may conflict of interest dahil kandidato kamag-anak o kandidato, hindi na dapat alamin kung nagkakadayaan o hindi? Kung mayroong mga security breach, magandang maimbestigahan at malaman,” Sotto, who also serves as the Senate President, said in a press conference.",
        paragraph2: "(Do they mean that if there is a conflict of interest because the investigator is a candidate or has a relative who is a candidate, they should no longer look into whether there is cheating or not? If there’s a security breach, it’s important for it to be investigated and found out.) “Bakit pipigilin natin ‘yung mga nag-iimbestiga? Dapat nga concerned ‘yung mga kandidato, concerned ‘yung mga kamag-anak ng kandidato baka magkakadayaan,” he added. (Why would we prevent those who must investigate? Candidates or their kin should actually be concerned if there might be cheating.)For his part, Lacson said the investigation is not only about cheating against one particular candidate but for all, and it also affects the “integrity of elections in general.” He also said that senators’ mandate is to practice their oversight function."

        paragraph1: "The Russian Soyuz capsule carrying NASA’s Mark Vande Hei and his cosmonaut peers Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov was scheduled to undock from ISS at 2:45 a.m. EDT (0645 GMT) and make a parachute landing in central Kazakhstan nearly five hours later. The landing zone lies roughly 250 miles (400 km) to the northeast of Russia’s space launch facility at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Vande Hei, 55, completing his second ISS mission, will have logged a U.S. space-endurance record of 355 consecutive days in orbit, surpassing the previous 340-day record set by astronaut Scott Kelly in 2016, according to NASA.",
        paragraph2: "The all-time world record for longest single stay in space was set by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov who spent more than 14 months aboard the Mir space station, returning to Earth in 1995. Dubrov, 40, who launched to the ISS with Vande Hei last April from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, will be completing his first spaceflight, sharing 5,680 Earth orbits and more than 150 million miles in space with Vande Hei, NASA said. Shkaplerov, 50, just ending his rotation as the latest ISS commander, is a veteran of four missions to the orbital outpost, accumulating 708 total days in space, far exceeding Vande Hei’s 523-day career tally, according to NASA. Shkaplerov began his latest space station stint last October."

        paragraph1: "The Philippines has been observing National Women’s Month as a way to celebrate, empower and defend the rights of women. The high-profile case of Jalandoni and Thompson highlighted the importance of awareness about women’s rights and also the reality that there’s still a long way to go before people unlearn and end the act of justifying violence against women (VAW). Last March 18, police in Tagaytay City confirmed they had rescued Jalandoni, whose photo of herself with bruises and wounds spread on social media, as she asked for help from friends after she said she had been beaten up and detained by actor Kit Thompson.Jalandoni’s friends and staff of the hotel, where the pair was staying, had alerted authorities.",
        paragraph2: "Jalandoni was taken to the emergency room while Thompson was taken to a police station for questioning on the same day. On May 19, police filed a complaint against Thompson for violation of Republic Act No. 9262, or the Anti-Violence against Women and Children Act. Several netizens who reacted to the case expressed shock, disappointment, and anger over the violence inflicted on Jalandoni allegedly by Thompson, her boyfriend. Some, however, expressed opinions on social media that the beating of Jalandoni “can’t be helped” as the actress must have done something wrong to deserve the violence."
